# Wine-quality-prediction
 
This project consists of prediction model for predicting the “quality” of a wine. To assist
with the same,a regression model for the two
datasets containing the red wine and white wine attributes. The prediction result helps
the business to be prepared ahead for the future scenarios.
Key concepts involved are as follows:
1. Use of ML studio platform to partition the datasets.
2. Creating a regression model to train it with training set and test the accuracy with
corresponding test set.
3. Use of data visualization to present the findings obtained.
